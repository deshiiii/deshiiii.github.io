I conducted UX-driven quantitative research for a major Plaion video game IP, supporting strategic decisions around product growth and audience development. By surveying players worldwide — including both the franchise’s existing audience and players of competitor titles — the research surfaced clear opportunities for trans-media expansion into formats such as television and film. In addition, the work identified market-specific localisation strategies to strengthen engagement and improve the IP’s performance across key regions.
