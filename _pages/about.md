Quant. UX Researcher and Market Analyst formally affiliated with [CAMS (EHESS)](https://cams.ehess.fr/). Until recently based at the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idmreTQzeg0) in Berlin.

Specialised in identifying and modelling online micro and macro user behaviour dynamics with computational methods. Over the course of my research career, I have worked at the intersection of industry and academia (PhD, Computer Science) working mainly in the field of digital media
and entertainment.

Semantically, interested in Computational Social Science and it's applications to industry.
Methodologically, interested in `MMMs`, `surveying`, `causal inference`, `information theory`
and `complex networks` to name a few!
