Specialised in quant. user research and market analytics, with work ranging from my doctoral collaboration with Deezer to more recent quantitative UX research for EA and Plaion. My focus is understanding and modelling multi channel user and market dynamics in online platform environments.

Methodologically, I work with causal inference, MMM, surveying, algorithmic auditing and complex networks.

I’m especially drawn to projects that connect with my broader interests, including Music Information Retrieval and Video Games.

Check out my projects to see what I have worked in the past!
